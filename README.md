# Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment - Winter 2022
## Atlantic Technological University
## Author: Ross Downey (G00398275)
## Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin
***

This repository exists as part of the assessment of the "Machine Learning and Statistics" module for the Higher Diploma in Computer Science in Data Analytics.  
The main component of this assessment is the Jupyter notebook "Keras-project" contained in the "Project" folder. The repository also contains a number of jupyter notebooks which were compiled during the term. These notebooks are located in the "Exercises" folder. The jupyter notebooks downloaded from the lecturer's Github repository have also been included for posterity.
A requirements.txt file has also been added to run the notebooks with minimal configuration.

## Install
***


These are the steps to install the required software packages to run the notebooks:

1. Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/),
 or should the entire Anaconda package not be required download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download [CMDER](https://cmder.net/) or other suitable console terminal.



## Keras-Project Notebook
***

This Jupyter notebook contains an example of a time-series anomaly from the Keras website, and a discussion of the concepts regarding this anomaly.

## Run
***

This is how to run the notebook

1. Open console terminal
2. Enter 'jupyter lab'
Note: Jupyter lab is run on your default internet browser.
3. Open the Keras-Project.ipynb notebook located in the Project folder

Alternatively, the following badges can be clicked to run the notebook:

Contained within this repository are a number of jupyter notebooks.<br>
The main notebook is located in the "Project" folder. In this folder is the "Keras-project.ipynb" file.<br>
This file is a jupyter notebook which discusses an example on the Keras website of a model built <br>
to detect anomalies in datasets using a reconstruction convolutional autoencoder model. <br>
A plot from the model is shown below which shows the model data and the outliers in the data <br>
![](../images/anomalyPlot.jpg)<br>
The plot indicates that the model has identified the data that is anomolous to the regular data <br>
<br>
This repository also contains a number of smaller notebooks which were created during the semester as part <br>
of the assessment of the Machine Learning and Statistics.<br>
These notebook are located in the "Exercises" folder. There are three in total (Statistics, Models and Parameters)<br>
