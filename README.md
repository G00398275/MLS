# Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment - Winter 2022
## Atlantic Technological University
## Author: Ross Downey (G00398275)
## Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin
***

This repository exists as part of the assessment of the "Machine Learning and Statistics" module for the Higher Diploma in Computer Science in Data Analytics.  
The main component of this assessment is the Jupyter notebook "Keras-project" contained in the "Project" folder. The repository also contains a number of jupyter notebooks which were compiled during the term. These notebooks are located in the "Exercises" folder. The jupyter notebooks downloaded from the lecturer's Github repository have also been included for posterity.
A requirements.txt file has also been added to run the notebooks with minimal configuration.

## Install
***


These are the steps to install the required software packages to run the notebooks:

1. Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/),
 or should the entire Anaconda package not be required download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download [CMDER](https://cmder.net/) or other suitable console terminal.



## Keras-Project Notebook
***

This Jupyter notebook contains an example of a time-series anomaly from the Keras website, and a discussion of the concepts regarding this anomaly.

## Run
***

This is how to run the notebook

1. Open console terminal
2. Enter 'jupyter lab'
Note: Jupyter lab is run on your default internet browser.
3. Open the Keras-Project.ipynb notebook located in the Project folder

Alternatively, the following badges can be clicked to run the notebook:

## Credits
***

I used a number of different packages in this jupyter notebook to help simultate data (numpy) and plot data (matplotlib, seaborn) etc. 
Details of the packages used are included below:

### Numpy

Numpy, or numerical Python, is a library used in Python to create different types of arrays or multi-dimensional matrices, and includes a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. In this case Numpy will be used to simulate data using the numpy.random package based on certain mathematical distributions.  

### Pandas
 
Pandas is an open source library built for data analysis and manipulation in Python

### Matplotlib
  
Matplotlib is a plotting library used in python to create visual plots from data. For this case Matplotlib will be used to create certain plots to help present large amounts of numerical data, generated using Numpy, in a clear and concise manner using histograms, charts etc.
